# Normal Map Composer
Composes a Normal Map from siz separate images, each representing the surfaces facing in X, Y,and Z.

This repositry will not be activly maintained and is just a me leearing dots and making a toll for a game I am creating. Obviously this tool would perform mush better in a cpute shader, however this is intended for use with small pixel art images and as such was not designe with lage datasets in mind.
