# Normal Map Composer
Composes a Normal Map from six separate images, each representing the surfaces facing in X, Y,and Z.

This repositry will not be activly maintained and is just a me learing Unity Dots and making a tool for a game I am creating. Obviously this would perform much better in a compute shader, however this is intended for use with small pixel art images and as such was not designed with large datasets in mind.
